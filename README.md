# Calenda App for Flying For You

This project, named "Calenda App for Flying For You," is a React application designed to provide a user-friendly calendar experience. The project utilizes various dependencies and tools to enhance the development process.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hdepoumps/calenda_app_for_flying_for_you.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd calenda_app_for_flying_for_you
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   
### `npm install`
   

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them.

### `npm run scsscompile`

Runs the Sass compiler in watch mode, compiling SCSS files from the `src/style/scss/` directory to the `src/style/css/` directory. It does not generate source maps and uses the "expanded" style.

## Configuration

The project includes configuration files for ESLint and Browserslist to ensure a consistent development environment. You can customize these configurations to suit your specific needs.
